# NoiseUI

**Live Demo** :

**Purpose**:
Saw this sort of interface in a lecture video awhile ago and I was pretty impressed how cool to see 3 wave forms merged together. Wanting to play around with something like that as I learn Random distribution and Perlin noise, went ahead and created another UI project to build a playground for wave forms. This might extend into an interface for creating random textures down the line.
